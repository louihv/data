          <p>My name is Mikaela Louise A. Garao, I was born and raised in Parañaque City, and I am currently a 2nd year student in National University MOA 
            currently taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am interested in pursuing a career that will bring me joy and 
            satisfaction in the future. Initially, thank you for allowing me to introduce myself.
            During my high school years, I didn't anticipated that I would take BSIT, it was rather unexpected for me to choose upon enrolling 
            but so far I am enjoying the stress it was inflicting me. As a matter of fact, I previously took Cookery classes as a supplementary 
            subject in high school because I wanted to lay back from challenging myself. In addition, some of my hobbies include writing poems,
             proofreading, sketching, watching movies, films, and documentaries seldom . When I am not involved in my academic responsibilities, 
             I am usually with the nature or indoors doing leisure activities. What is especially interesting about these hobbies is that they 
             help develop my soft skills, such as critical thinking and creativity.               
            I want to mention that creativity and critical thinking are two of my greatest strengths, which I can use both in real life as well 
            in professional or academic settings. Up until now, they have been a great help to my efforts. One weakness I’d like to mention is 
            multi-tasking. I need to engage with multiple tasks to keep me from functioning whether it be academic or in professional environment. However, I am working hard to turn this weakness into a strength, by exposing myself to situations where I control myself and finishing the activity on hand before jumpring to the next.               
            I am thrilled to continue my academic interests and possible take up Masters' after, but thinking about that will come up in the 
            future as I have to excel in coding and learn the essential first. I am also certain that my skills and enthusiasm will make me 
            a strong candidate for my future plans. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for considering my application. Please 
            feel free to ask any questions you might have.
