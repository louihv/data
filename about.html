                the 2nd century CE. All but one of these constellations have survived to the present day and are officially recognized by 
                the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Most of them are associated with stories from Greek mythology.
            
                And with that in mind, this website aims to shun enlightenment to the public about the people that are involved and/ or created the zodiac signs that many of us 
                rely through multiple reason.

                <p id="right">Even though the constellation now known as Coma Berenices was suggested by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the 2nd 
                century BCE, it was not included on Ptolemy's list. </p>
             <p id="bot_right">The only Greek constellation that is not included among the 88 modern constellations is Argo Navis (the Ship Argo).</p>

                <p id="baby_zodiac">The cuneiform tablet preserves part of a list of twenty-five stars or small star groups. The stars are arranged 
                    in the order that they cross the north-south meridian at the highest point of their daily journey across the sky (an event 
                    known as culmination).The most common set of names for the zodiacal signs used by the Babylonians was: the Hired Man, the 
                    Stars, the Twins, the Crab, the Lion, the Furrow, the Balance, the Scorpion, Pabilsag, the Goat-Fish, the Great One, and the Tails.
                    The Babylonian sky was inhabited by a large number of constellations. These constellations were named after various animals, gods, 
                    people, and inanimate objects. The constellations were grouped into three “paths” in the sky associated with three of the principle 
                    gods in the Babylonian pantheon. The northern constellations were assigned to the path of the god Enlil. Among these constellations 
                    were the Great Twins, the Crab, the Lion, and the Wagon, which correspond to Gemini, Cancer, Leo, and the Big Dipper. In the middle
                     of the sky are the stars in the path of Anu, which include the Bull of Heaven, the True Shepherd of Anu, and the Balance, respectively 
                     Taurus, Orion, and Libra, as well as a constellation called simply the Stars, corresponding the Pleiades. In the south are the stars
                      in the path of Ea, which include the Scorpion, the Pabilsag (named after a god), and the Goat-Fish, corresponding to Scorpio, 
                      Sagittarius, and Capricorn.</p>
